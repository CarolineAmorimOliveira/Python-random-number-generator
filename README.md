# Programming Project 1 - Python Random Number Generator

This project was created as part of the **Introduction to Programming Concepts** course at Valencia College (Dual Enrollment). It demonstrates basic Python concepts including:

- Random number generation
- Use of conditionals (if/else)
- Math module functions
- Simple console output

## 🔧 How It Works

- A random number between 1 and 100 is generated.
- The code checks if the number is **even** or **odd** using the modulo operator.
- It then calculates the **square root** of the number using the `math` module.
