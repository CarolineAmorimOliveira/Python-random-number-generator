# Programming Project 1 - Python Random Number Generator

This project was created as part of the **Introduction to Programming Concepts** course at Valencia College (Dual Enrollment). It demonstrates basic Python programming concepts using:

- Random number generation
- Conditional logic with the modulo operator
- Math module functions
- Console output formatting

## 🔧 How It Works

- A random number between 1 and 100 is generated.
- The program checks if the number is **even** or **odd** using the modulo operator.
- It calculates the **square root** of the number using the `math.sqrt()` function.
- Finally, it prints the number, its kind (even/odd), and its square root rounded to two decimal places.
